# Java-Exercises
## Question 1
Methods in Java are a fundamental concept that allows us to abstract tasks, making them repeatable and organized. They play a crucial role in defining the behavior of classes, ensuring that the objects we create can perform the actions we expect them to. 
In this project, I created a basic SavingsAccount class to manage a savings account's balance. We'll focus on implementing various methods to interact with the account balance.

## Question 2
In this project, I will use classes, methods, and objects to create a simple arithmetic calculator. <br>
The calculator will be able to:

<br> 1. Add two integers
<br> 2. Subtract two integers
<br> 3. Multiply two integers
<br> 4. Divide two integers
<br> 5. Apply the modulo operator on two integers

## Question 3
#### Build A Droid
<br> I've set up a robot workshop to build some droids. 

<br> I defined the state and behavior of the droids using instance fields and methods.

## Question 4
#### Car Loan
In this project, I have developed a java program to calculate the monthly car payment that a user should expect to make after taking out a car loan. This program takes into account the car loan amount, interest rate, length of the loan in years, and the down payment made on the car.
<br>
##### How It Works
The car loan calculator works by taking the following inputs from the user: <br>

Car Loan Amount: The total amount of the car loan that the user wishes to take.

<br> 1. Interest Rate: The annual interest rate for the car loan, represented as a percentage.

<br> 2. Length of the Loan: The number of years over which the car loan will be repaid.

<br> 3. Down Payment: The initial payment made by the user when purchasing the car.
