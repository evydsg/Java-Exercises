# Java-Exercises
## Question 1
Methods in Java are a fundamental concept that allows us to abstract tasks, making them repeatable and organized. They play a crucial role in defining the behavior of classes, ensuring that the objects we create can perform the actions we expect them to. 
In this project, I created a basic SavingsAccount class to manage a savings account's balance. We'll focus on implementing various methods to interact with the account balance.

## Question 2
In this project, I will use classes, methods, and objects to create a simple arithmetic calculator. <br>
The calculator will be able to:

<br> 1. Add two integers
<br> 2. Subtract two integers
<br> 3. Multiply two integers
<br> 4. Divide two integers
<br> 5. Apply the modulo operator on two integers
